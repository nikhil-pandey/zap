Based on the following information, create a detailed prompt for a coding large language model:

Original task:
<task>
{{ message }}
</task>

Repository Metadata:
<repoMetadata>
{{ repo_metadata }}
</repoMetadata>

Craft a comprehensive prompt that:
- Clearly states the task and its objectives
- Provides necessary context from the project structure
- Incorporates insights and considerations from the reflections
- Specifies any constraints or best practices to follow
- Identifies potential challenges and how to address them
- Outlines steps or approaches to complete the task
- Defines any technical terms or project-specific jargon
- Specifies the exact files to be modified and how
- Clarifies the expected output format or any required documentation

Ensure your prompt leaves no room for ambiguity. Be concise yet thorough. Anticipate and address any potential misunderstandings a coding agent might have.

Enclose your crafted prompt within <prompt> tags.
